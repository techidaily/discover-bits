## How did I Get Infected?

The Browser Assistant Virus, which is an extension of the Trojan horse virus, is extensively spread by it in the computer system. This malicious software gets installed in the system without any user’s consent and starts replicating it. 

In addition to this harmful file, the browser assistant virus even starts setting up several processes that can change the settings of Windows, like the Windows Registry in your system. The threat of this virus is generated and spread by stand-alone extension, which is then rapidly spread over occupying the major part of the processing unit. 

Thus the Browser Assistant virus then turns out to be a harmful software program and disrupts the functioning of the system.
