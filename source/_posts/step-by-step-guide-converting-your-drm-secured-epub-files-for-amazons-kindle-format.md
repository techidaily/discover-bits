When asked about how to read EPUB on Kindle, probably the most often recommended method is to convert EPUB to Kindle format (such as Mobi), and the tool suggested is using Calibre, or some online eBook converter sites. However, even if you use these tools to convert EPUB to Kindle, you may see tips like "Sorry you cannot convert this file because of the DRM problem".

It says that your EPUB files are protected with DRM. So at this time our problem is not just to convert format, but also remove DRM first. This guide is about **how to convert DRM protected EPUB to Kindle**. Hope it could resolve your problems perfectly.

If drm free, you won't see these tips, and things become easy to go, all you need is to [send the epub books to Kindle](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)

### Why we convert DRM protected EPUB to Kindle

You know EPUB is one of the most common eBook formats. It's a free and open eBook standard format in eBook world. So you may find that if you purchased some books from bookstore like Google Play, rakuten Kobo, Nook, most of those files are in EPUB format.

But the problem is that after you downloaded these EPUB to your computer, transfer them to your Kindle devices, you find you can't open them. This is because Kindle doesn't support EPUB format.

And, in fact, there is another reason that prevents us reading EPUB on kindle. Most of EPUB eBooks are protected with DRM, some are with Adobe DRM, and others are with Nook DRM. Just because of the DRM problem, though we paid money, we can only read our files on dedicated devices. The reasons we convert DRM EPUB to Kindle format are as follows:

* We want to read EPUB books on Kindle devices
* Kindle doesn't supports EPUB format
* EPUB books are protected with DRM
