After downloading an ebook online, you will probably get[**an acsm file**](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/).

Don't worry! this post provides you with a step-by-step guide on how to open acsm files on Windows, Mac, iPad, iPhone, Android and even on Kindle.

### Part 1\. How to open acsm file on Mac, Windows

The official tool to open acsm file on Mac or Windows is Adobe Digital Editions. So to open acsm file on desktop, let's first download and install Adobe Digital Editions.

Step 1 **Download and run Adobe Digital Editions to your Mac or PC.**

Adobe Digital Editions for Windows download: [ADE for Win (8.13MB)](http://download.adobe.com/pub/adobe/digitaleditions/ADE%5F4.5%5FInstaller.exe)

Adobe Digital Editions for Mac download: [ADE for Mac (23.2MB)](http://download.adobe.com/pub/adobe/digitaleditions/ADE%5F4.5%5FInstaller.dmg)

Step 2 **Authorize Your Adobe Digital Editions with Adobe ID.**

The first time you run Adobe Digital Editions, a window will pop up asking you to authorize your computer with your Adobe ID. If you do not have an Adobe account yet, you can create a new one. Then you need to input your Adobe ID and password to authorize your computer with ADE.

![authorize adobe ID to open acsm file](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/authorize-adobe-id.png)

Step 3 **Open ACSM with Adobe Digital Editions.** 

In this step, you should first download the ACSM files to your computer. Once you've downloaded the ACSM file, either double-click it or drag and drop it into the main interface of Adobe Digital Editions (ADE). The file will automatically open with ADE. If it doesn't open automatically, right-click the file and select _"Open with" -> "Adobe Digital Editions 4.5."_ A window will then appear showing the download process (a network connection is required).

![open acsm epub](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/open-acsm-ade.png)

After the download process is complete, your ACSM files will open, and you can view them in the library. It's important to note that ADE will automatically convert your ACSM files into actual eBook formats—either EPUB or PDF. You can find the downloaded EPUB or PDF books in the specified location. To check the exact location of your downloaded books, you can go to the _"File" menu -> "Item Info" -> "Location."_

Here is also your default Adobe Digital Editions file path: 

****For Windows:** _...\\ My Documents (Documents)\\ My Digital Editions_ ...  
**For Mac**: _Users\\ Your computer name\\ Digital Editions\\_ ...

Now your acsm files are downloaded to Adobe Digital Editions with .epub or .pdf. These two formats are real ebooks. Make sure **your eReader is authorized with the same Adobe account**, otherwise you will be prohibited to open the EPUB books.

**Note:**

You can only read the ACSM on Adobe Digital Editions on Mac and Window computer. It means you cannot open the books with any other EPUB Reader or PDF Reader on Windows or Mac. The reason is that the ACSM files are protected with Adobe DRM, which made a limitation on the ACSM to be only compatible with ADE. Here comes the best solution--remove Adobe DRM and convert ACSM to PDF/EPUB/Mobi to read on any device you want.

 Just download the most powerful tool [Epubor Ultimate](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) to help you remove drm from Adobe ACSM files.

**Detailed Guide**: [How to Remove DRM from Adobe Digital Editions](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/).

[](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) [](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) 

Above method is the easiest way to open acsm files on Windows/Mac. I believe it is enough for most of you to open your acsm files. But next I will also add more information about this topic which you may concern very much.

### Part 2\. How to Open ACSM File on iPad/iPhone

How do I read an ACSM file on my iPad/iPhone? If you have this question, there are two methods available for you.

#### Method 1\. Open ACSM with Adobe Digital Editions

As we've mentioned, Adobe Digital Editions (ADE) is the official app for opening ACSM files, and it's free to download from the Apple App Store, completely ad-free. Simply search for "Adobe Digital Editions" in the App Store and install it on your iPhone or iPad.

**Step 1:** Authrize Adobe id on iPhone.

Please ensure you authorize your Adobe Digital Editions on your iPhone first. Tap the menu at the top left corner, then tap "Settings">>"Authorize". 

![Adobe Digital Editions for iphone](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/ade-on-iphone.png)

Input your Adobe ID and passwords to authorize Adobe ID on iPhone.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

**Step 2:** Open acsm with Adobe Digital Editions on iPhone.

 After downloading the ACSM files to your iphone directly, select the ACSM file and choose "Open in 'Adobe Digital Editions'."

![open acsm on iphone](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/open-acsm-adobe-iphone.png)

Then the acsm will be fullfilled by Adobe Digital Editions on iPhone.

![open acsm on iphone](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/downloading-acsm-to-pdf-iphone.png)

A few seconds later, you can see the acsm file be converted to a real book and displayed in your ADE library.

![open acsm on iphone](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/read-acsm-iphone.png)

Now you can read acsm on your iPhone with ADE.

#### Method 2\. Remove DRM from ACSM and Open with Apple Books 

If you find the reading experience in ADE less than ideal, we suggest a better alternative: using Apple Books. To do this, simply [convert ACSM to EPUB and remove DRM](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) before transferring them to your iPad or iPhone. Once converted, you can open these files in Apple Books for a more seamless reading experience.

### Part 3\. How to Open ACSM File on Android

What is the right way to open ACSM files on Android? Which ebook reading app supports acsm file format? Adobe Digital Editions is the official one, no matter on desktop, or on mobile devices. Thus, you can also install ADE on your Android device and open the ACSM with ADE for Android.

### Part 4\. How to Open ACSM File on Kindle

If you want to open ACSM files on your Kindle device, the steps will be a little different. The reasons are as follows:

\--There are no ADE alternatives app for us to install on Kindle.

\--Though we can remove DRM from ACSM and convert them to epub or pdf with ADE, Kindle doesn't support these two formats at all.

So the perfect solution is to convert ACSM to kindle format. To open ACSM on Android, iPad, iPhone, Kobo or Sony eReader, we just need to remove the Adobe DRM without need to convert formats. But for Kindle, we must remove DRM and also convert the format to Kindle Mobi/AZW3 format. Don't worry![Epubor Ultimate](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/), the tool I mentioned above can still do the job!

Step 1   **Download and run Epubor Ultimate.**

Step 2   **Open ACSM with Adobe Digital Editions and get the converted EPUB/PDF files.**

Make sure you can open ACSM files with ADE on your computer. Then run Epubor Ultimate. At the left column, you can find your your ACSM books under the "Adobe" tab. 

Step 3   **Convert ACSM to Kindle format.**

Just drag the books from the left column to the right blank, choose Kindle mobi/azw3 as the output format and start converting.

![](http://www.epubor.com/images/faq.png) Frequently Asked Questions on "How to Open acsm file?"

##### Q: How to open ACSM file online? 

A: There are several online ACSM converters that claim they can convert ACSM files to PDF or EPUB. I've tested many of them, and only a few actually work, and even those are often unstable. My advice is not to upload your ACSM files to online converters. Additionally, there is no reliable way to open ACSM files online.

##### Q: How to set ADE to open ACSM files automatically?

A: To set ADE open ACSM file automatically, please navigate to Adobe Digital Editions top menu bar, click _"Library">> "Preference"_, then the set up window will pop up. Here just check the box "_Automatically download your synced books to this device_".

The ACSM File Converter that you recommend for converting ACSM files for use on Kindle, epubor, does not actually open ACSM files!

Thanks for using our software!  
 Yes, Epubor can't convert .acsm file to Kindle books directly.

 ACSM file is the key to download Adept ePUB/PDF books, so you need open acsm file with Adobe Digital Editions to download Adept ePUB/PDF book files at first, then use Epubor software.

 After you download ePUB/PDF files, then drag to Epubor software, and choose output as Kindle, then click "Convert".

 All done.

Hello,

 I have been having an issue since few days and Kobo support can't help. 

 I bought a book on their online service, and tried to open it with ADE but get following error :

 Error getting License. License Server Communication Problem:  
 E\_LIC\_ALREADY\_FULFILLED\_BY\_ANOTHER\_USER

 This is the second book I buy with them, I did not have issue to open the first .ACSM file and to transfer it to kindle. The Adobe ID I use has the same email address on the kobo service, I tried to reauthorise ADE various times but it did not help. Also to download new copies of the -ACSM file after installing ADE. 

 Can you please assist?

 Thank you,

 Ale

Hi,

 If the ADE told you "Error: E\_LIC\_ALREADY\_FULFILLED\_BY\_ANOTHER\_USER", that indicates the authorized account is not compatible with the book. If you are sure the Adobe account has no problem, please contact the eBook retailer support to bind the book to your Adobe account.

 For more tips you can read this post: <http://www.epubor.com/how-to-read-sonykobo-ebooks-on-ade.html>

You haven't said how one can open an acsm file with an Android 5.1 device. I have installed the ADE android app, but can't find out how to link it to acsm files so that it will open them. The Default App Manager doesn't help. Can you help?
