Hi,

 I purchased Epubor Vitalsource downloader. I was trying to convert a textbook into a pdf file, but it failed. There was a output file, in which there is a phrase "Please refresh your browser" with a picture of a robot on all pages. I tried many times, but all failed. Please let me know how to solve this problem.

 Thanks

 For this reason I would like to ask you a temporarly trial for the full conversion.

[How do I get paragraph break in convert to text?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 5/1/2020 8:55:02 AM 

I just purchased an annual license.

 The full version is NOT treating text the same as the full version.

 In trial version, Converting KFX book to Text maintained the paragraph breaks. The Full aversion does not -- so the book is one huge single line.

 How do I get paragraph break in convert to text? 

 FYI, as a work around, I tried converting to PDF as a work around. However, PDF adds LINE breaks (specific to the printed page) as well as Paragraph marks. But it uses the SAME control code for each, so I can't just search and replace line marks and leave paragraph marks.

 I would appreciate your help and guidance to solve this .

 Thanks.

[Ultimate Epub Conversion Issue](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) \-- 3/11/2019 1:43:39 AM 

When converting Kindle books to Epub format, quote marks (") within the book text will be converted to &quot. This occurs in some books but not others. When it occurs in a book it is consistent throughout the book. Thus far I have converted problem books to PDF format and the issue disappears in PDF. Any likelihood this issue will be address in a future update

[graphics garbled](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 11/15/2020 5:22:17 AM

[Free trial makes "only text" ePUB correct?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 7/27/2022 3:31:34 PM 

Hi,

 I have installed the free trail and converted an Adobe DE ePub. It turns out just flat text without pictures / book cover etcetra. Is this correct? Is this due to the free trial, or is this "just what it is"?

 Thx!

[Corrupted conversion](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 11/30/2019 7:38:52 PM 

I brought a licence so I can fully convert an Kindle book into a PDF, however when I do this the output is corrupted. All I now get is the front cover and all the text is randomly scattered throughout the pages.

 When I only had a trail version it did convert it properly but only the first 60 pages.

 Why is it now not working?

[How to change the look of the output file](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 2/5/2020 2:05:20 AM 

Hi! I love this app! I just converted my first book, and the output file is 62 pages. It could be much longer if the text was larger/more readable.

 How do I change the output font options?

 Thank you!

[Output whole book as Text File with License.](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 11/9/2020 11:27:01 PM 

Seems like the program won't strip the DRM or whatever after all, total waste of money, none of the converters (zamzar, calibre ect. can convert the amz to pdf bcuz' they claim the DRM is still on).   
 I can't find a way to convert the entire book into a text file, even though without the license you can do that for 20% of the book.   
 Is there an option for that somewhere that I'm missing, or can you at least add it? I really want to do that for 100% of the book.

[Do you sell software that tells me the ksn for my Kindle PC?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 9/7/2020 7:59:23 AM 

Apparently Epubor does this but internalizes this information and removes the DRM and turns it into a text file, which removes all formatting and pictures. I want to convert Kindle to Epub, not to text.

[PDf conversion problem](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 2/5/2023 11:51:41 PM 

After conversion from azw3 format to pdf, the text is cut off on the right of every page. Changing viewing pdf options does not fix it.

[Not one file but need separate to chapter](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 4/4/2019 7:56:40 AM

[Trial version preview](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 4/10/2021 9:35:42 AM 

I'm checking out the trial version and removed the DRM from a couple of books. When I look at the previews, they show up in my web browser as really ugly html with no formatting or chapter breaks. Is this really what the final version will look like? It's nice that the text is there, but if the books are so ugly I can't stand to read them, it doesn't do me any good.
