When Amazon officially launched **Kindle Unlimited Subscription** on July 18, 2014, most of the ebook lovers were so excited and cannot wait to order the Kindle unlimited subscription service. With the "all-you-can-read" Kindle unlimited subscription, Amazon did appeal a lot of subscribers. Now about three years has passed, are you still the loyal Kindle Unlimited subscribers? Is Kindle Unlimited Subscription worth it? We will list all things you may want to know about Amazon Kindle unlimited so that you can decide whether Kindle Unlimited is worth paying 9.9 bucks per month or not.

### 1\. How many titles does Kindle Unlimited contain? _Kindle Unlimited offers over 1.4 million titles._

Started with 640 thousands titles, now Amazon owns the biggest catalog (1.4 million titles) which exceeds its competitors Oyster and Scribd. Although none of the major publishing houses have allowed their books available on Kindle Unlimited library, Amazon has exclusive books from its self-publish platform and some small publishing houses. In other words, it is lack of books from famous authors. 

Since there are many authors choose to self-publishing, the Kindle Unlimited library keeps growing. On the contrast, the Oyster has closed its ebook subscription service. Since almost all the books from Kindle Unlimited library are Amazon exclusives, you can not read them at other places. 

### 2\. What're the differences between books from Kindle Unlimited and Kindle store? _Kindle Unlimited books are only a smart parts of Amazon ebook store._ 

The Amazon is also the biggest ebook seller around the world which has about 3.17 million books available. Amazon’s Kindle Unlimited titles are only 38% of the Amazon ebook store. Besides the Kindle Unlimited catalog, it has many books from the big five publishers (Penguin Random House, Hachette, Macmillan, HarperCollins, or Simon & Schuster) which you cannot find in Kindle Unlimited library.

### 3\. What's the Kindle Unlimited price? _9.99USD per month._ 

Just like other ebook subscription service, the Kindle subscription offers 30-day free trial. To start your free trial, you must have an Amazon account with a current, valid credit card. In the meantime, you have to enable 1-click payments. You can go to Manage Default Address and [1-Click Settings](https://www.amazon.com/gp/css/account/address/view.html) to turn on your 1-Click payment. Your Kindle Unlimited membership will be continued until you cancel it. You will pay 9.99 USD for it per month.   
 Amazon also allows consumers to order the Kindle Unlimited and give it as a gift to anyone else. This service is also called Kindle Unlimited Pre-Paid subscription. There are three options--6 months($59.94), 12 months($119.88) and 24 months($239.76). When you place the order, it will ask you write down the recipient’s email and select the delivery date. You can order it for yourself or anyone else.

###  7\. How many Kindle Unlimited books can I have at one time? _Ten books in total._

You can keep ten titles at your Amazon account and there are no due dates. If you want the 11th book, you have to delete one to borrow another book. But there is no limit to how many books you can read in a month. So you can read as many kindle books as like.

### 8\. Kindle Unlimited also contains audiobooks and magazines.

If you are an audiobook fan, you must be familiar with [Audible Whispersync for Voice](https://www.amazon.com/wsv/). Now you can still use this powerful function to switch seamlessly between reading and listening. However, only the books contain “with narration” are free. There are some Kindle Unlimited books with audiobooks available, but they are not free. You can go straight to the page--[books with narration in Kindle Unlimited](https://www.amazon.com/Books-with-Narration-in-Kindle-Unlimited/b?ie=UTF8&node=9630682011) to browse the free audiobooks.

![kindle unlimited with narration](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/witht-narration.jpg)

The Kindle Unlimited new feature allows members to read magazines for free. According to the “new to Kindle Unlimited” image, you can see many popular magazines such as Good Housekeeping, COASTAL LIVING, Reader’s Digest, Town&country, Bon Appétit, or Yoga. You can visit [Kindle Unlimited Magazines&newspapers page](https://www.amazon.com/Magazines-Newspapers-Kindle-Unlimited-Eligible/s?ie=UTF8&page=1&rh=n%3A156736011%2Cp%5Fn%5Ffeature%5Fnineteen%5Fbrowse-bin%3A9045887011) to browse more magazines.

### 9\. How much are the Kindle Unlimited books?

People choose to order the Kindle Unlimited books because they want to save money. Do you really save your money? If you have ever browsed the Kindle Unlimited store, you will know that most books from the Kindle Unlimited are at the very low price which is less than 5 USD. Many of them are even 0.99usd. So if you only read one or two books every month, you'd better not enroll Amazon unlimited subscription. With 9.9 bucks, you can buy two or even more books and own your purchased books in your account forever. However, if you are a really avid reader and read more than 10 books per month, Kindle unlimited service can be a good choice.

I have Amazon Prime and you are allowed 10 books per month. Prime Reading works the same as Unlimited with no time limit and return if you want to check out another.

"Live Chat" means just that, a live person. a "robot" is not a live person. Robot couldn't answer my question...

 My question/comment is that I purchased my Kindle in Arizona as well as my Kindle Unlimited subscription, through Staples/Amazon.com. and pay monthly through my U.S. bank account. I winter in AZ and am in Canada rest of year. How can I use this one Kindle Unlimited subscription/account to purchase books both in Canada and USA, without having to purchase a subscription in both countries? I wish the limit wasn't 10 books at a time, as I like to keep certain books in series in my library so I can follow the series with future publications.   
 I hope you can help me. Thank you.

 My husband had a kindle and a kindle unlimited account. He has been deceased since August 2021, and I don't know how to cancel his subscription. Can you help? I hate to cancel a credit card as I have other monthly fees deducted from it.
