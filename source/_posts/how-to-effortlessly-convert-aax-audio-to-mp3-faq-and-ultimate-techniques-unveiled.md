**What is an AAX file?** AAX is an enhanced audible format used for Audible audiobooks. Since 2021, AAX is the only audio format that you can download from the Audible.com library.

For those who want to listen to their Audible books better, converting AAX to MP3 is definitely the best choice. Here are three ultimate ways to convert AAX to MP3 so that you can listen to Audible on more than one platform.

### Method 2\. Convert AAX to MP3 for Free Online

Online Audible Converter always comes first because it is light and no installation requirement. Here are our picks:

[Zamzar >>](https://www.zamzar.com/)

[Convertio >>](https://convertio.co/)

[online-audio-converter >>](https://online-audio-converter.com/) 

This method is simple; all you need to do is upload your AAX files and choose the output format as MP3\. Some converters may require you to input your email address so that they can send the converted MP3 files to you.

![online audio converter](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/online-audio-converter-4.24.png)

The steps involved in using online Audible converters are simple. However, there are some obvious drawbacks to consider. It can be bothersome to see ads on almost every online converter website, which can detract from the user experience. Some users may also dislike the slow uploading speed. A stable and fast internet speed is crucial for uploading an Audible file. Moreover, almost all online converters have size limits. If your AAX audiobook is larger than the preset file size, you may not be able to use the online service unless you purchase their service or your upload may fail.

### Method 3\. Convert AAX to MP3 with AudibleChapters (free)

AudibleChapters is a freeware designed by Ano from a German forum. After several updates, the current 3.3 version is up to date. It's totally free and concentrates on AAX/WAV conversion. 

But when I use this freeware, the time I am waiting for completing conversion is so long. I tried a 7 minutes AAX audiobook and it spends about 3 minutes. And when the software is converting, my computer cannot work smoothly. Also, you cannot do batch conversion.

Despite these problems, I will also show you the procedure step by step.

#### Step 1: Download AudibleChapters

Download [AudibleChapters33.zip](https://mega.nz/#!20l0nbJL!JuLnkkKZI4Sc8s1Fi4zhtaklumNkt3VEjLcrzc4wxP8) and unpack. Then you will get below files.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

#### Step 2: Launch AudibleChaptersGUI.exe

Launch AudibleChaptersGUI.exe. If you want to convert AAX to MP3, you can choose the first option from the pop-up window. After this step, the real conversion interface will come out.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

#### Step 3: Convert AAX File to MP3

Choose your AAX file and target director. Check **MP3** in compression options. Then click "**Start**". The default option is totally enough for your conversion. Of course, you can see much more options you can choose. You can set them as you like.

![Audible Chapters GUI](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/Audible-Chapters-Gui.png)

Once you click "Start", those options will be gray and cannot be clicked anymore. And the information of conversion procedure will be showed in the "**Status / Result**" column. If your AAX audiobook has a big size, then it will stay in "**Decoding audiobook using audible library**" for a long time.

![AudibleChapters Status Result](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/AudibleChapters-Status-Result.png)

The time of this conversion procedure depends on your audiobook size. Please wait patiently. When the conversion is done, it will pop up a window showing the completed status. Click "**OK**". The "**Done**" message will also be displayed in "**Status / Result**".

![AudibleChapters Conversion Status](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/AudibleChapters-conversion-status.png)

<a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123732/7443" target="_top" id="2123732">

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

After conversion, it will automatically create a folder named as the AAX audiobook. You can find the mp3 file in that folder. Some users feedback it seems to always create mp3 split by chapter.

If you want to convert next AAX audiobook, you must close the current interface and start next conversion from [Step 2](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/). There is no batch conversion option.

Thank you for using our software. If you are failed to convert aax files, please just upload it to cloud and then send us the download link. Then we can test it at our side. Please don't worry. It is not because this file is over 1G.
