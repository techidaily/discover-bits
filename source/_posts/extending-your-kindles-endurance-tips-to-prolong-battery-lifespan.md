5\. Close Extra Functions/Apps: Close backlight and page refresh function. Close extra apps, videos, games, music and other progress. You can close them in your setting option. If the light is sufficient, especially during the day, I think there is no need to adjust the backlight level too high and you can completely close it.

Uninstalling battery sucking apps for your Kindle Fire could save your Kindle power.
