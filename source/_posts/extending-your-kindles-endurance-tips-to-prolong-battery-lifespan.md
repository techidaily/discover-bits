So you must know the Kindle battery life hours of each Kindle device to make your usage experience better. Combine your own habits, you will know when you have to charge your Kindle device.

 For Kindle 2, the battery will last 30 hours. For Kindle 3/4, the battery will last 15 hours. For Kindle Basic, the battery will last 14 hours. For Kindle Fire, the battery will last 9 hours.

Of course, the wireless, lightness, usage, device settings, web browsing, and downloading content can influence the duration of the Kindle battery.

4\. Close Network: When you turn on WIFI or 3G option, it takes much power to search for and connect to the close-by network.

This will save much more Kindle power. Tapping "Setting" and you will see the WIFI/3G or airplane mode option.

5\. Close Extra Functions/Apps: Close backlight and page refresh function. Close extra apps, videos, games, music and other progress. You can close them in your setting option.

If the page refresh function is useless for you, you can turn off it to extend the battery life. Especially for Kindle tablets, some additional apps will waste much power. Uninstalling battery sucking apps for your Kindle Fire could save your Kindle power.
