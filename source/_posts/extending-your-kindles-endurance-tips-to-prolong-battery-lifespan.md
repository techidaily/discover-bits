### Part 2\. Kindle Battery Life Hours of Each Kindle Device

With the specification of the Lithium-Ion battery, the Kindle battery can last several years before it needs to be replaced when recharging it wouldn't work anymore. It's better for you to charge the Kindle device even you don't use it. And don't wait until the battery is empty to recharge it. Long-term maintenance of empty power will harm to the battery. So you must know the Kindle battery life hours of each Kindle device to make your usage experience better. Combine your own habits, you will know when you have to charge your Kindle device.

**Amazon Official Data of Kindle Battery Life**

* **Kindle Fire HD 10** \- Up to 8 hours of reading, surfing the web, watching video, and listening to music.
  
* **Kindle Fire HD 8** \- Up to 12 hours of reading, surfing the web, watching video, and listening to music.
  
* **Kindle Fire** \- Up to 7 hours of reading, surfing the web, watching video, and listening to music.

**According to the user's feedback, Kindle battery life when you continuous using the Kindle device after one charge:**  
 For Kindle 2, the battery will last 30 hours. For Kindle 3/4, the battery will last 15 hours. For Kindle Basic, the battery will last 14 hours. For Kindle Fire, the battery will last 9 hours. For Kindle HD, the battery will last 8 hours. For Kindle Paperwhite, the battery will last 28 hours. For Kindle Voyage, the battery will last 21 hours.

Generally, Kindle e-Readers last longer than Kindle tablets. People often say a Kindle e-Reader can last a few weeks without backlighting and Kindle Fire may only last a couple days. I think it's because of the Kindle Fire apps consuming more power. Of course, the wireless, lightness, usage, device settings, web browsing, and downloading content can influence the duration of the Kindle battery.
