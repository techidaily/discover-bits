## Understanding the Discord Virus

The term “Discord virus” is an umbrella term used to describe malware programs found on the Discord platform. These malicious programs can hijack Discord accounts by stealing authentication cookies involved in the sign-in process.   
  
The most commonly seen malware on Discord is the [Remote Access Trojan](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) (RAT). Savvy cybercriminals use RATs to gain administrative rights, giving them full control of the compromised system. But RATs aren’t the only threat. Other forms of malware, such as Trojans, spyware, and adware, are also lurking in the shadows of Discord’s servers.

## How did I get Discord Virus?

### Falling Prey to Malicious Links

Ever wondered how users unknowingly get trapped in the web of cyber frauds? Well, the answer might surprise you. It’s as simple as clicking on a seemingly harmless link. Cybercriminals are notorious for spreading malicious links through Discord chat rooms. These links are like ticking time bombs, waiting to explode the moment you click on them, leaving your system infected.  
  
The scary part is that these links may appear completely legit, making it incredibly tricky to distinguish between a safe link and a malicious one. So, when you’re on Discord, it’s not just about having fun conversations; it’s also about being vigilant. Remember, one wrong click could open the door to a cyber-attack.

### Infected Files: A Wolf in Sheep’s Clothing

The second most common way to get the Discord Virus is through infected files. Cybercriminals are often seen lurking in the shadows, uploading these infected files and waiting for an unsuspecting user to download them. These files could be anything – an exciting game mod, a cool custom emoji pack, or even an innocent-looking image file.   
  
Like the proverbial wolf in sheep’s clothing, these files appear harmless on the surface but carry a nasty surprise within. When you download them, you’re unknowingly inviting the Discord Virus into your system. It’s always a good idea to double-check the files you’re downloading and ensure they come from a reliable source.

### The Deceptive Discord Installation File: Enter Spidey Bot

Not all villains wear masks, and not all viruses come from external sources. Sometimes, the danger lies within the Discord app itself. Cybercriminals have been known to spread a modified Discord installation file, corrupted with malware.  
  
One such infamous malware is the Spidey Bot. Named for its spider-like ability to creep into your system unnoticed, it is one of the primary culprits behind the corrupted Discord app file. Once it settles in, it wreaks havoc by corrupting your Discord app and compromising your system’s security.

## How to remove Discord Malware

### Step One: Install a Robust Antivirus

First off, you need to get your hands on a strong antivirus software. I highly recommend [TotalAV](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/). Not only has it been ranked as one of the best antivirus software by TechRadar and PCMag, but its user-friendly platform is perfect for those who aren’t tech-savvy.

It successfully provides real-time antivirus protection, ensuring your PC is consistently safeguarded from harmful malware.

### Step Two: Run a Full System Scan

After you’ve installed [TotalAV](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/), it’s time to let it do its magic! Run a full system scan on your Windows 11 PC. This might take a few minutes, depending on the number of files you have. Grab a coffee, sit back, and let the software do the work.   
  
During this scan, the antivirus software will thoroughly check every cranny of your computer. It’s like having a digital detective sifting through your files, hunting for any suspicious activity or potential threats.

###  Step Three: Follow the Antivirus Recommendations

Once the scan is complete, [TotalAV](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) will present you with a detailed report of its findings. If the Discord virus is detected, the antivirus will guide you on the necessary steps to eliminate it.   
  
Usually, it’s as simple as clicking on ‘clean’ or ‘remove’, and the antivirus will take care of everything else. But remember, each case can be different, so make sure to carefully follow the instructions provided by the antivirus software.

### Consider Manually Uninstalling Discord

In some cases, the Discord virus may have messed with the app’s original code. If you suspect this, it might be a good idea to uninstall Discord manually and then reinstall a fresh version from the official website. This way, you can be sure you’re starting from a clean slate. 

If Discord Virus is still there on your PC, try to find the culprit application and uninstall it. 

1. Right-click on the taskbar and select the **Task Manager**.  
![Open Task Manager](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Open-Task-Manger.png)
2. Watch out for the applications that are consuming the system memory even though you did not install or launch them.

3. Right-click on the suspicious application and open its file location.  
![uninstall suspicous files](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/uninstall-suspicous-files.png)
4. Delete the file from its root location.

5. Open Control Panel and click on **Uninstall a program** and check for suspicious apps. One by one, select and uninstall them.![uninstall the apps](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/uninstall-the-apps.png)

### **Delete Temporary Files**

The temporary files folder can also be a carrier of malicious files. Thus, we recommend deleting all the temporary files and folders regularly for the smooth running of the system. Removing the temporary files would also clear the unnecessary clutter from your system and free-up the valuable space.

Here are the steps to eliminate thre temporary files:

1. Open the Run command window.
2. Type **%temp%** and hit the enter key.![temp run command](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/temp-run-command.png)
3. This run command would navigate you to this path: **_C:\\Users\\\[username\]\\AppData\\Local\\Temp,_** that is, the temp folder.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

4. Select all Files and Folders of this folder and delete them. Don’t hesitate to delete them, as they are not essential for any of your tasks. ![Delete temp files](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Delete-temp-files.png)
5. Next right-click on the **Recycle Bin** and select **Empty Recycle Bin.**![Empty recycle bin](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Empty-recycle-bin.jpg)
