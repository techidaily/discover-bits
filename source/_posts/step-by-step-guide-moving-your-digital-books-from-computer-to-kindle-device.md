First, you have to make sure that all the ebooks are DRM-free and in MoBi format.

There are two ways to import ebooks to kindle. One is to copy ebooks to the documents of your kindle's disk after connecting kindle to computer via USB. And the other way is to send ebooks as attachment to kindle cloud, then Amazon server will automatically sync to kindle. Both ways have advantages and disadvantages. For example, the copied ebooks can not sync bookmarks, notes and page. While kindle cloud can only send ebooks under 50MB in size. So you should choose the method according to your needs. More detailed introduction are in the tree diagram listed below.

As shown above, transfer via WiFi and transfer via USB are the main methods to import ebooks to kindle. However, based on these two methods, it also can derive many different applications according to different demand scenarios. And the following is structured to progressively introduce them.

### 1\. WiFi Transmission 

#### a. Amazon Kindle e-book store

This is the most important access to legal e-books for people who have a good paying habits. And Amazon purchase experience has been done in one step. So you just need to find want to read e-book in Amazon's official website or Kindle devices with built-in Amazon Kindle store, the book will be saved in my content and sync to kindle devise bind the same account which you used to buy the book after you click the **Buy**  button. 

#### b. Amazon Kindle personal document service

Kindle Personal Documents Service is a free tool that allows you to send select file types directly to Fire tablets, Kindle e-readers, and supported Kindle reading apps registered to your Amazon account. These documents can be sent from an authorized email address or a Send to Kindle application.

You can send documents to your kindle device by emailing the documents to your Send to Kindle email address. Your Send to Kindle email address is a unique address that is assigned to you when you register your kindle device. 

#### c. Transfer e-books via experience edition web browser

Kindle provides an experience version web browser which can provide basic Web page browsing capabilities in order to fit the built-in Wikipedia, Baidu encyclopedia, Google content search. Of course, we can also use it to transfer e-books. E-books can be downloaded to the remote or local server in this way, then you can download e-books to your kindle.

This way can be downloaded from the provision of e-books on the remote or local server, the e-book download to Kindle. Besides this, there is an easier method which is Use [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/download) to build a Web server on the local computer, and then download e-books from Calibre's library to the Kindle through the browser. I have made a detailed presentation in the previous article Calibre tutorial: [transfer e-books through local wireless transmission](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/transfer/).

### 2\. USB Transmission

In addition to transfer e-books to Kindle device via WiFi transmission, the other way is USB transmission. Kindle device comes with a USB data cable which is used for charging the Kindle and copy the e-book file to Kindle. You just need to connect your kindle to computer with USB data cable. Then find your kindle folder on the local drive disk. All you need to do next is drag all the downloaded e-books to the folder.

It should be noted that you can also use OTG data cable to manage kindle disk's documents if you   
have an Android mobile device. But it is as convenient as these method. At least you have to buy a OTG cable which you don't use it often. 

The above is all the Kindle e-book transmission method. You can choose different method according to your needs.
