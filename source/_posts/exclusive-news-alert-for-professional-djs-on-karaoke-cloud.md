## Exclusive News Alert for Professional DJs on Karaoke Cloud

[![Karaoke Cloud Pro announcement](https://i0.wp.com/pcdj.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/karaokecloudpro-announce.jpg?resize=845%2C321&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/pcdj.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/karaokecloudpro-announce.jpg?fit=1000%2C500&ssl=1 "Karaoke Cloud Pro announcement")

**Dear Karaoke Cloud Pro Subscriber:**

Like many of you entrepreneurs and business owners, we at DigiTrax are also suffering from the current economic climate, and the downturn in our businesses associated with social distancing.

In response, many KJs are turning to online karaoke shows to keep singers’ interest high, and to lessen the effects of loneliness we are all experiencing. KJs in general are a smart and enterprising group of individuals, and we’ve seen many innovative approaches to finding ways to continue serving our singers online while public gatherings are forbidden.

To aid you in that service, effective immediately, we are lowering the monthly cost of the [Karaoke Cloud Pro](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) package built into your installation of PCDJ Karaoki to $19.99 per month, from the standard price of $49.99.

It is our sincere hope that this reduction in price will give you some necessary breathing room as we all confront the ongoing crisis, and figure out ways we can be safe and healthy, while also being successful.

We all have a role to play during this crisis, and I extend my personal thanks to those KJs who continue to work at soothing, inspiring and giving emotional release to everyone caught in the throes of the pandemic, especially individuals serving on the front lines, working in the support industries, or just going stir-crazy at home.

Sincerely,

**Joe Vangieri**  
**CEO DigiTrax Entertainment/Karaoke Cloud Pro**

**Note:** Your subscription has already been set to bill at the reduced rate of $19.99-a-month. No further action is required.
