In this blog post, we’ll go over exactly how to get rid of redirects from search and shopping ads so you can enjoy your browsing experience.

## What is Search and Shopping Ads Redirect?

Search and shopping ad redirects are a form of online advertising that redirects users from one web page to another. This type of ad is commonly used to drive traffic to specific products or services. The ads appear as sponsored links or banner ads and usually contain text, images, or videos. When clicked, the user is redirected to a new page or site. These redirects can often be intrusive and interfere with the user’s experience. It’s important to be aware of this type of advertising as it can potentially harm your online reputation and cost you money.

Below is an example of the ads that come between when you are scrolling a particular website.

## How did I get infected?

Search and shopping ad redirects are typically caused by malicious software, such as adware. Adware is a malware designed to display intrusive advertisements on the victim’s device.

On the other hand, malware is malicious software designed to infiltrate a computer system without the user’s knowledge and cause damage or steal information. 

Adware can be spread through several methods, including websites that contain malicious codes, deceptive email attachments, fake software updates, and downloads from untrustworthy websites. It is important to note that the source of the malicious code can be difficult to trace and identify.

Once installed, the malicious code will modify your browser settings, redirecting you to potentially dangerous websites when you search for certain keywords or visit certain web pages. It may also show advertisements while browsing. Since these ads are often disguised as legitimate search results, distinguishing them from actual search results is difficult. 

It is important to note that these redirects can also come from other sources, including third-party applications, toolbars, and browser extensions. Therefore, ensuring that all your programs are updated and secure is important to protect yourself from potential security risks. Additionally, it is wise to scan your computer regularly with an up-to-date anti-virus program to detect any malicious code that may have been installed without your knowledge.
