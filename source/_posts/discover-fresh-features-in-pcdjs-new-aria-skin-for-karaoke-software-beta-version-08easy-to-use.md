New in [Karaoki](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) public beta build 0.87039 is a new “Aria Blue” skin option; a darker interface that goes easy-on-the-eyes for those long karaoke events. Also included are a number of minor bug fixes and performance tweaks.

The [prior public beta of Karaoki](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) removed redundant, unused code that feed up valuable resources for a snappier and more stable hosting experience, especially with the database and singer/song history. Version 0.8.7039 further builds on the prior release with additional performance improvements.

0.8.7039 is largely considered a [maintenance release](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintenance%5Frelease), minus the inclusion of the brand new skin option (another variant will be available in the next update). We are working on a number of new features right now, including integration of the [PartyTyme.net](http://www.partytyme.net) store for on-the-fly in-app purchases of karaoke songs. We’ll post an update to this blog when it’s ready for download.

We suggest Karaoki users download and install this new 0.8.7039 release now (just install with your existing version closed to update automatically). If you have feedback feel free to post in the comments section below or on the [PCDJ Facebook User Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/208451843303338/). _Enjoy!_
