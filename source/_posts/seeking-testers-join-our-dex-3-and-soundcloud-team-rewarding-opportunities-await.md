## Seeking TESTERS: Join Our DEX 3 & SoundCloud Team – Rewarding Opportunities Await!

[![DEX 3 DJ Software with SoundCloud Support](https://i0.wp.com/pcdj.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/dex3-soundcloud-intergration.jpg?resize=706%2C321&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/pcdj.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/dex3-soundcloud-intergration.jpg?fit=706%2C360&ssl=1 "DEX 3 DJ Software with SoundCloud Support")

**SoundCloud** support is coming to DEX 3 soon. DJs will be able access and stream a catalog of 190+ million songs, without ever leaving the DEX 3 browser. We wrote in-depth about SoundCloud and what support means for DEX 3 customers a few months ago [here](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/).

We’re currently in the home-stretch — SoundCloud support for DEX 3 is eminent. Our quest to make DEX 3 the most well-rounding and complete DJ software program included in-app support for streaming, and SoundCloud (specifically their Go+ subscription) has come to bat with a more-than-adequate solution. Already surpassing the now-defunct Pulselocker streaming subscription platform for DJs in functionality and ease-of-use, SoundCloud is the right partner for us, and the service is surely going to be a hit with DJs and Venues alike.

**What we need now is a handful of beta testers to field-test SoundCloud support in DEX 3 (pro).** 

We’re only looking for a few ideal candidates, for both MAC and Windows based testing. Applicants should meet/exceed all DEX 3 Pro system requirements (as found at the [bottom of this page](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/)) and have ample time to test and report over the next 4-5 days.

If you feel like you’re a fit, look forward to SoundCloud streaming, and have the time to dedicated to testing and thoroughly reporting on any issues, please fill out the form below and we will respond promptly!
